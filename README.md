# MaintenanceConsole

Goal is a library for Teensy 3+ that implements a serial port interface that acts as a maintenance console with features:

* A built-in, extremely simple ftp service for SD card file management.
* Suppress main program output when in maintenance mode.
* Assign console to any non-software serial interface.
* Pass custom commands to main program for processing
